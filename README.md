# [`DIALTONE`](https://dialtone.earth)
> IMPORTANT: This should sound like something from a scirence fiction novel about the near future of civic technology.

- A public information system for civic coordination and education
- A virtual librarian for mathematics, physics, and engineering
- Publicly owned and assembled robots, radios, and shared tools
- Live maps and status for real-world projects and robotic operations
- A marketplace for parts, services, training, and integrations
- Tools for secure identity, keys, and signatures

### Who uses Dialtone
- Students:
  - use the virtual library to learn mathematics, physics, and engineering through guided problems tied to real systems
  - explore examples and tickets that connect theory to robots, radios, mapping, and field work
- City councils and civic teams:
  - plan new public spaces as a living system: build plan, operations plan, and long-term maintenance plan
  - coordinate contractors, parts, schedules, and safety requirements through tickets with budgets and acceptance checks
  - monitor ongoing work through maps, status, and records (what is deployed, where it is, and whether it is healthy)
- Builders and operators:
  - assemble radio and robot kits, bring devices onto the encrypted network, and run missions with auditable workflows
  - run field trials, learn from failures, and ship improvements as repeatable upgrades
- Developers, researchers, and documentation contributors:
  - contribute passively by submitting documentation fixes and small tickets
  - contribute actively by writing tests, improving plugins, training and evaluating models, and rolling updates to deployed systems

Dialtone supports a spectrum of use:
- Passive: read the library, file a ticket, fund a ticket, submit a documentation change.
- Active: run tickets end-to-end, deploy and monitor fleets, and operate robotic systems in the field.

### Example use cases
- Small goods delivery and distribution
- Localized manufacturing and industrial automation
- Forest Fire Detection and Suppression
- Disaster Response and Recovery
- City Beautification and Maintenance
- Civic Gardens and Urban Agriculture
- Cloud Seeding to enhance cold season snowfall
- Infrastructure Inspection and Maintenance
- Environmental Monitoring and Conservation
- Public Safety and Emergency Response
- Search and Rescue

### `DIALTONE` a Virtual Librarian 
  - guides individuals and teams to actionable tasks
  - finds civic problems and turns them into questions
  - turns questions into tickets
  - turns tickets into tests
  - turns tests into upgrades across real machines

### Build kits: hardware you can assemble
- Radio kit: an open, garage-buildable field uplink for moving control, telemetry, and video when standard networks are unreliable.
- Robot kit: a reference robot stack (compute, sensors, control) designed to join the network, publish telemetry, and accept upgrades safely.

### Marketplace
- Dialtone links builders and operators to parts, services, and integrations that work with the platform.
- Hardware: bill of materials, sourcing links, and compatible alternates for radio and robot kits.
- Services: assembly help, repairs, calibration, and field support.
- Software: plugins, integrations, and deployment recipes that can be installed and validated through tickets.
- Trust signals: compatibility notes, safety notes, and practical constraints (power, range, compute).

### Deep technical education
- Structured learning paths for the math and engineering behind real systems:
  - networks and secure communication
  - sensing, measurement, and monitoring
  - control and automation
  - maps and geospatial reasoning
  - radio links and field connectivity
- Learning is tied to doing: each concept maps to tickets and small, verifiable changes.

### Physical shops and labs
- Find a local shop or lab to build and test radio and robot kits.
- Access shared equipment (soldering, RF test gear, 3D printing, calibration tools) and repeatable build procedures.
- Run acceptance tests on hardware before field deployment (power, thermal, radio link, sensor and control checks).


### Teams
- A 90 day desert sprint to build, test, and deploy a working robotic system end-to-end.
- Built around immersion: deep technical learning paired with daily hands-on building, integration, and field validation.
- Outcomes:
  - a functioning robot + radio link + operator workflow running on Dialtone
  - documented procedures (build notes, deployment runbooks, troubleshooting)
  - a set of tickets and tests that make the system repeatable for the next team
- Sprint structure:
  - Weeks 1-2: assemble kits, connect devices, establish monitoring and logs
  - Weeks 3-6: integrate sensors and control loops, build operator workflows, start field trials
  - Weeks 7-10: harden reliability (power, thermal, link quality), add safety checks and rollback paths
  - Weeks 11-13: deploy a complete mission workflow and demonstrate repeatable operations

### How the system creates real outcomes
- `DIALTONE` turns civic questions into clear tasks that people can complete and reuse.
- Work is organized as tickets with dependencies (a checklist that knows what depends on what), so teams can move from plan to build to verification without losing track of what is required.
- Tickets can be funded. They can have budgets, acceptance checks, and clear deliverables, making them suitable for paid work and public procurement.

Example tickets:
- Sourcing a metal supply (vendors, specs, lead times, acceptance checks).
- Engineering a new part (design notes, fit checks, field validation).
- Delivery of small goods (routing, handling, tracking, proof of delivery).
- Software upgrades to vision models (evaluation, safety checks, rollout and rollback plan).
- Improving documentation (install steps, operator runbooks, troubleshooting guides).

### Vision
- A public library of mathematics, engineering knowledge, and field-tested procedures.
- Publicly owned tools that make it easier to build and maintain real systems.
- A shared civic operating picture: maps, status, and accountability for ongoing work.
- A marketplace that connects communities to parts, services, training, and integrations
