### description:
- see https://github.com/holepunchto/bare
- Docs and Requirements 
- 1. allows dialtone to start and connect to predefined topic
- 2. keeps a local duckdb of key/content-hash mappings with metadata
- 3. possibly uses an addon https://github.com/holepunchto/bare-addon
- 4. see netcode here https://github.com/holepunchto/hyperdht
- 5. something on native building here https://github.com/holepunchto/bare-native
- 6. to see a list of all bare modules https://github.com/orgs/holepunchto/repositories?language=&q=bare&sort=&type=all
- 7. https://github.com/holepunchto/bare-net
- 8. use https://github.com/holepunchto/bare-build to build for native
- 9. example of building an app https://github.com/holepunchto/keet-appling-next
- I would like this plugin to allow a `./dialtone.sh swarm <topic>` command 
- it should use this as a minimal network code with bare 
- https://github.com/holepunchto/hyperdht
- this does not need to integrate with any golang code other than the CLI to start it. 
- as a plugin it can have its own install and build that dev.go can call via CLI
