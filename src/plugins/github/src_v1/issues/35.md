### description:
- 1. rename dialtone-earth to www
- 2. update cli tools code to use the new folder name for www commands.
- 3. this will make it clear that this is the public website 
- 4. after you verify the www page can be built and published check back in that you are following the agent.md
- 5. now make the subtitle of the main page have a typing like effect as they show up. and then make it cycle between 3 different subtitles about unified robotic networks and other cool subtitles that sound scifi and match the project goals
