### description:
- US customs data is public. every single shipment entering the country is logged
- company names, factory names, volumes, dates.
- importyeti makes it searchable. find a competitor doing $500k/mo. search their company name. see exactly which factory in china they're sourcing from, how often they reorder, and at what volume. contact that same factory directly. order the same product with your logo on it. you're now sourcing from the exact same manufacturer and they have absolutely no idea.
- this takes about 15 minutes and it's completely legal. the amount of people paying 3x markup on aliexpress when the actual factory is one search away is genuinely embarrassing lol
