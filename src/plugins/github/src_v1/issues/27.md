### description:
- 0. use `agent.md` to guide all work. and make a new branch via the CLI before starting work
- 1. I have not tested building for the robot recently 
- 2. use `dialtone-dev` and `dialtone` cli to deploy and new build
- 3. the robot is at 192.168.4.36 if you need to debug directly but prefer using the `dailtone` cli tools. 
- 4. some of the `dialtone` commands may be out of date for deploying to the robot computer.
- 5. after it is started verify the webpage is running at the tailscale domain name.
- IMPORTANT! use the workflow in `agend.md` and keep the plan and pull-request up to date
