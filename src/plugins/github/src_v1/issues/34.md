### description:
- The system should have tests that start a loop showing the following workflow. If the workflow completes it demonstrates the `dialtone-dev developer` cli improving its own code and knowledge. 
- # Workflow Loop
- 1. `dialtone-dev developer` starts the loop and finds the next best issue to solve for this robot given its capabilities like existence of a camera or GPU
- 2. the issue is written to a new file in the `features` folder with name `features/feature-branch
- 3. A sub-agent is given the issue via `dialtone-dev subagent --task task.md`
- 4: The sub-agent hook calls back with complete.
- 5. the developer agent recives the message that the sub-agent is done and creates a pull request back to the `dialtone` github repo solving that issue and closing it
- 6. show that the `dialtone-dev developer` monitoring agent can see when the sub-agent has gotten stuck or needs assistance
- 7. create a simple test that works with the live repo to submit an issue with a simple problem to solve and the sub-agent starting with that new issue and completing it to the finial pull-request submission by the monitoring agent. 
- 8. `dialtone-dev developer` starts the loop
