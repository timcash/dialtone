[2026-01-26 20:53] Implemented full suite of triage label shortcuts (--p0, --bug, --documentation, etc.) in the github plugin. Updated issue_review.md with a comprehensive labeling reference table. Verified functionality by applying multiple labels to issue #97. Documentation and CLI are now fully synchronized and optimized for rapid triage.
